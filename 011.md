## Is anything else more important than you?

Hello friend and welcome to 2021,

This year, protect your best asset: you.

No matter how productive, inventive or anything else you might be, the best thing you can do for yourself is to take care of the only thing that is irreplaceable—yourself.

I don’t mean hire bodyguards, but be in the best of health possible. Exercise more? Eat healthier?

2020 was a year of the COVID-19, we’re unsure how that will play out this year and as you’ve read from me a few times last year—never stop keeping an eye out for opportunities, there’s lots of  opening in the marketplace.
