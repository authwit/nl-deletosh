# Getting Everything You Can - #1
## Never fall in love with...

Hello friend, 

In the next few emails, I will share lessons from my distant mentor, [Jay Abrahams](https://www.abraham.com/) (the 21.7 billion dollar man) — with application to digital products.

Here's a start:

> One of the biggest mistakes, probably the biggest mistake, people make in any business is that **they fall in love with the wrong thing**. They fall in love with their product, service, or company.

The wrong thing can even be your solution to a problem, it can be a your company's ethos, it can be your teammates. You notice the trend — don't fall in love with what you assume, fall in love with:

Your Clients and their problems.
