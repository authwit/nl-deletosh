# The COVID Vacuum
## What are your hidden opportunities?
Happy Monday friend,

COVID has thought me an important lesson. 

Everything can turn around in a snap. It is teaching me to play and think defensively.

The good news is, in unusual times, the market creates vacuums, vacuums that are filled by opportunist — like you.

Here are some interesting vacuums opening in the market:

- Rise in remote work (this might be the new normal)
- Rise in virtual experiences 
- Rise in "realistic" online shopping
- Increased availability of [Free] Open Source Solutions
- Rise of Virtual friends and the emergence of closed-small-networks
- Rise in contactless commerce
