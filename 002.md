## Everyone wants to Code. Not You.
### 
Happy Sunday,

If you are to start learning to code today, it’s overwhelming but don’t worry, there’s a simpler alternative: don’t learn to code.

Here are two alternate paths:
- “No Code” and
- “Coding is plumbing”

The core to both of these ideas lies in focusing on the hardest bit of today’s business, figuring the problem you want to solve. Coding comes a distant second.

Well, you have to code at some point but you don’t know how to code? That’s a smaller problem — __build a no-code MVP__.

Your MVP is working our great and you’ve reached the limit of what it can do? “Plumb” your code together using many great frameworks (a secret in software is, no-one ever starts from scratch). This requires more investment in time but then, you’ve confirm (with you MVP), it’s worth it.

### How?
