# This Growth Channel Beats Social Media by 3,800%
## How can you tap into a sustainable growth channel?

Happy {Day of Week}!

For what to focus on fueling your organic growth, the choice is often between email and social media.

The winner is Email. By far.

Dele are you nuts?! It’s 2020, who still uses email. Hold my pen friends, let me share some recent research from [Hubspot][1]:

- There are 3.9 billion daily email users
- __Mobile opens account for 46 percent of all email opens.__
- 35% of business professionals check email on a mobile device.
- __73% of millennials prefer communications from businesses to come via email.__
- Marketers who use segmented campaigns note as much as a 760% increase in revenue.
- __35% of marketers send their customers 3-5 emails per week.__ 
- 78% of marketers have seen an increase in email engagement over the last 12 months
- __80% of business professionals believe that email marketing increases customer retention.__ 
- 59% of respondents say marketing emails influence their purchase decisions.
- __Marketers who use segmented campaigns note as much as a 760% increase in revenue.__

That’s all nice but here’s the ultimate bomb-shell:

You get [$38 for every $1][2] spent on email. That’s a 3,800% return-on-investment!

Despite the hype, social media does not come close! If you’re not using email to reach your potential clients and users, you’re loosing out.
 
__What does this mean for you, your product and business?__

Spend most (or all if you can do just one) of your energy on email as a sustainable growth channel.
