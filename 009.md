## How to compare failure
Hello friend,

Here's your shortcut to bringing a product to market — look at failed products.

I don't mean look at them to see what you should not do, that's common-sense. Look at them to see what you share and how to differentiate your offering.

Here's the Jay Abraham's snippet:

> The first step in navigating any journey through treacherous business waters is to know exactly what your strengths and weaknesses are. And how they relate to your competition. Yet almost no one in business does this strategic analysis.

Don't confuse competitive analysis for strategic analysis. 

There's a difference in knowing where you stand on a ladder vs. if the ladder is needed at all — this can be your edge.
